# D502 WGU BSDA Capstone: Loan Default Prediction and Policy Simulation

My capstone for the WGU BSDA program. Utilizing the Home Credit dataset on Kaggle, I will build a reproducible data cleaning pipeline, perform EDA, and develop a predictive model for calculating the odds of a loan defaulting as well as optimizing loan profits for the Home Credit bank. This project will additionally include an approval cutoff simulation and an interactive dashboard.

## Objectives:
- Build a reproducible data cleaning pipeline
- Build a baseline default risk model using application-level features
- Add engineered features from supporting tables via aggregation (to prevent exploding table joins)
- Evaluate model performance
- Simulate different approval cutoffs to quantify tradeoffs (risk, volume, profits/losses)
- Provide an interactive Tableau dashboard

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle - **Home Credit Default Risk**
- Raw files are stored locally and **will not** be committed to this GitHub Repo


\## Environment

\- Language: Python 3.11+

\- OS: Ubuntu (local development)

\- Storage: SQLite

\- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn (will add others as needed)



\## Quickstart

1\. Create a virtual environment

2\. Run dependencies

3\. Run pipeline scripts



\## CI

GitHub Actions runs linting and tests on all pull requests and main
